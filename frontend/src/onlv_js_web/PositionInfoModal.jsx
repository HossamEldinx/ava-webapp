// This file creates a simple pop-up window (a "modal") that shows detailed information
// about a specific item from an ONLV project, like a task or a group of tasks.
//
// The main idea of this file is to:
// 1. Receive an object containing data for a "Position" or a "ULG" (a group of positions).
// 2. Display this data in a clean, easy-to-read format inside a pop-up window.
// 3. This modal is for viewing information only ("read-only"). You can look at the data, but you can't change it here.
// 4. It appears on the screen when a user wants to see more details about a specific item,
//    and it can be closed by clicking a button or the background.

import React from "react"; // We need to import React to create our component.

// This is our main pop-up window component. Think of it as a reusable building block for our app.
// It takes two pieces of information (called "props") to know what to show and how to close itself.
const PositionInfoModal = ({
    positionInfo, // This is the object that holds all the data we want to display in the pop-up.
    onClose, // This is a function that tells the app how to close this pop-up window.
}) => {
    // This is a safety check. If for some reason there is no information to display (`positionInfo` is empty),
    // we simply show nothing. This prevents the app from crashing.
    if (!positionInfo) return null;

    // This is a small helper function that takes a JavaScript object and converts it into a nicely formatted string.
    // The `JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)` part makes the text readable by adding line breaks and spaces,
    // much like formatting a document to make it easier to read.
    const formatObject = (obj) => {
        return JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2);
    };

    // This is the visual part of our component. It describes what the pop-up will look like on the screen.
